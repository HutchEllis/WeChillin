### **How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**
Approached it as segmented as possible. Every feature was decoupled from the others when possible to make development easier. These features could be expanded to allow reuse of features between apps.

### **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**
I ran it and used it as a normal user. I also checked the logs. This is important because issues are never expected so you have to run into them a lot of the time before you can fix them.

------------


### **Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
I had to innovate in the development proccess. There were many pitfalls of my original approach that had to be ammended to better fulfill the user experience.

### **In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
The component that demonstrated my knowledge the most was the login. I got to show the ability to initialize a database and store the user information and also query that data to detect if a user's login was successful.
